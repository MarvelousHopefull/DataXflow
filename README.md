# Jimena-To-D2D
This is an extension to the Jimena software developed by the Bio-Informatics chair of the Julius-Maximilians-University-Wuerzburg. 
Jimena allows dynamic simulations of biochemical interactions and is used to investigate processes in humans, animals and plants. 
These processes are represented as graphs.

You can find the original Jimena software and a more detailed explanation of it here:
https://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/bioinfo/computing/jimena/

The Jimena-To-D2D extension is meant as a tool to bridge the usage of Jimena and D2D.
D2D allows to test and fit the graph used in Jimena to collected experimental data.
The added GUIs help with the generation of files needed for the usage of D2D. 
You can find the D2D software here: https://github.com/Data2Dynamics/d2d

## Installation
Downloading the JimenaE.jar file provided in the master branch gives you access to the complete Jimena software 
including the additions needed for working with D2D. The JimenaE.jar file can be used like any other executable file, openenig the Jimena GUI.
