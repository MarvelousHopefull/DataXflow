In this folder, scripts are provided that allow setting the inital guesses of the parameters to be fit by the D2D framework as well as setting best values from a previous optimization run of D2D. Such a script is in particular useful if after changing some parts of the topology not all parameters are to be fit from the scratch from default values. The setup scripts summerize functions for a complete D2D parameter optimization run including loading data, compiling, setting paremeters and starting the actual fitting routine. For details, please see the corresponding paper named at the landing page of the git repository.
